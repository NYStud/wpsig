# EMV® 3-D Secure Requirements for Risk Assessment

The EMV® 3-D Secure Protocol (hereafter, "3DS") describes a
"frictionless flow." The “frictionless” flow involves risk assessment
by the issuing bank (or its Access Control Server partner) without
requiring a user gesture. On the Web, this is generally accomplished
by collecting device information (via JavaScript) during checkout and
looking for stability in the device information across transactions.

As changing browser behaviors alter the device information landscape,
the [Web Payment Security Interest
Group](https://www.w3.org/securepay/) is holding discussions about
what emerging browser capabilities could help fulfill risk assessment
requirements and privacy requirements.

This document is a requirements document to support those discussions.
